This page defines key concepts and features of Sentry. It's not an exhaustive list of all the terms you'll learn using Sentry, but a short list of concepts and features that will help you understand the rest of the documentation. This list is also not in alphabetical order. Instead, the entries are in "learning" order so that each definition builds on the ones that come before it.

## Key Concepts

Sentry SDK - Sentry's software development kit. SDKs are programming language/framework-specific. When you instrument your application with one of our SDKs, your application sends event data to Sentry so we can send you information about how your software is performing.

sentry.io - Sentry's user interface where the event information captured by our SDK is visualized.

event -

error

issues

transaction

attachments - Files uploaded in the same request, such as log files. Unless the option to store crash reports is enabled, Sentry will use these files only to create an event, and then drop them.

**Attachment** -

**Breadcrumb**?? - Breadcrumbs create a trail of events that happened prior to an [issue](). These events are very similar to traditional logs, but can record more rich structured data.

**Context**?? - Custom contexts allow you to attach arbitrary data to an event. Often, this context is shared among any issue captured in its lifecycle. You cannot search these, but they are viewable on the [Issues page]().

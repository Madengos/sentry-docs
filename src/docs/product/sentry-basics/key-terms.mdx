The key terms and concepts defined on this page are the fundamentals of Sentry. While we define new terms as you come across them throughout our documentation, having an understanding of the key concepts and features defined here will make it easier to learn more complex ideas about the product.

This list is ordered so that each definition builds on the previous ones.

## Key Concepts

**event** - An event is one instance of you sending data to Sentry. Generally, this data is an error or a transaction.

**Sentry SDK** - Sentry's software development kit. SDKs are programming language/framework-specific. When you instrument your application with one of our SDKs, your application sends event data to Sentry so we can provide you with error and transaction data about your app.

**sentry.io** - Sentry's user interface, where the event data captured by our SDK is visualized.

**error** - This varies by platform, but in general, if there's something that looks like an exception, it can be captured as an error in Sentry. Sentry automatically captures errors, uncaught exceptions, and unhandled rejections, as well as other types of errors depending on platform.

**issues** - An issue is a grouping of similar error events. Every error event has a set of characteristics called its fingerprint, which is what Sentry uses for grouping. For example, Sentry groups events together when they are triggered by the same part of your code. This grouping of events into issues allows you to see how frequently a problem is happening and how many users it's affecting.

**transaction** - A transaction represents a single instance of a service being called to support an operation you want to measure or track, like a page load, page navigation, or an asynchronous task. Transaction events are grouped by the transaction name.

**project** - A project represents your service or application in Sentry. You can create a project for a particular language or framework used in your application. For example, you might have separate projects for your API server and frontend client. For more information, check out our [best practices for creating projects](/product/accounts/getting-started/#4-create-projects). Projects allow you to scope events to a distinct application in your organization and assign responsibility and ownership to specific users and teams within your organization.

**team** - Teams are associated with your Sentry projects, and their members receive issue notifications in addition to becoming issue owners. Learn more about [setting up teams](/product/accounts/getting-started/#2-set-up-teams).

**DSN** - Data Source Name. A DSN tells a Sentry SDK where to send events so the events are associated with the correct project. Sentry automatically assigns you a DSN when you create a project. Learn more in our full [DSN documentation](/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/).

**environment** - `Environment` is a Sentry-supported tag that you can add to your SDK, intended to refer to your code deployments' naming convention, such as _development_, _testing_, _staging_, or _production_. Environments help you better filter issues and transactions among other uses. Learn more in our full [Environments documentation](/product/sentry-basics/environments/).

**release** - A release is a version of your code deployed to an environment. When you notify Sentry about a release, you can identify new issues and regressions associated with it, whether an issue is resolved in the next release, and apply source maps. Learn more in the full [Releases documentation](/product/releases/).

**performance monitoring** - Performance monitoring is the act of tracking application performance and measuring metrics like how many transactions are being sent and the average response time for all occurrences of a given transaction. To do this, Sentry captures [distributed traces](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/) consisting of transactions and [spans](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/#traces-transactions-and-spans) to measure individual services and operations within those services.

**alerts** - Alerts let you know about problems with your code in real-time by sending you notifications when certain alert rule conditions are met. There are several types of alerts available with customizable thresholds and integrations.

## Key Features

Following are descriptions of key features in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

**Projects** - The **Projects** page lists the projects by teams of which you're a member and provides you with a high-level overview of your projects. From here, you can go to the **Project Details** page for each project for a more granular view. Learn more in the full [Projects documentation](/product/projects/).

**Issues** - The **Issues** page displays information about grouped errors in your application. From here, you can go to the **Issue Details** page for a more granular view of any issue. Learn more in the full [Issues documentation](/product/issues/).

**Performance** - The **Performance** page is the main view in sentry.io where you can search or browse for transaction data. The page displays graphs that visualize transactions or trends, as well as a table where you can view relevant transactions and drill down to more information about them. Learn more in the full [Performance documentation](/product/performance/).

**Releases** - The **Releases** page provides a high-level view of each release version, the associated project, the adoption stage of each release, the authors of each commit, the percentage of crash-free users, and the percentage of crash-free sessions. Learn more in the full [Releases documentation](/product/releases/).

**Release Health** - **Release Health** provides insight into the impact of crashes and bugs as it relates to your user's experience and reveals trends with each new issue. You can view Release Health data either from the **Issue Details** page by selecting the commit ID listed under Last Seen or from the **Releases** page. Learn more in the full [Release Health documentation](/product/releases/health/).

**Alerts** - The **Alerts** page is where you can create new alert rules and manage existing ones. Learn more in the full [Alerts documentation](/product/alerts/).

**Discover** - **Discover** provides visibility into your data across environments by allowing you to query events and unlock insights into the health of your entire system. The **Discover** page visuzalizes the results of queries. Learn more in the full [Discover documentation](/product/discover-queries/).

**Dashboards** - **Dashboards** provide you with a broad overview of your applicationâ€™s health by allowing you to navigate through error and performance data across multiple projects. Dashboards are made up of one or more widgets, and each widget visualizes one or more **Discover** queries. Learn more in the full [Dashboards documentation](/product/dashboards/).
